Workflow!


Installation:
============
Make sure your conda environement is actually activated - this was causing me problems.

I had an error with some .dll's not being installed in the right place. I think this is because I have an old conda version.
This was fixed by compying some dlls to the System32 dir (cuz it's always on PATH).

First is installed all the dependencies via

    pip install pyproject.toml

This extension is meant to be prebuilt, meaning it can just be pip installed, with no build.

However, given I'm changing the sourcecode, _I_ need to rebuild the extension via:

    jlpm run build

Then to actually install the rebuild plugin I have to run

    pip install -e

This is insanely slow! Might not be the best development option.

Setup symbolic link to allow live syncing:

jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .

Dev workflow
============

Launch the server by navigating to tests/ and running python project.py --ContentsManager.allow_hidden=True
the --ContentsManager.allow_hidden=True is currently needed and I need to worry about, because JLab refuses to serve hidden files as of I think 4.0.

Once changes are made, build with jlpm build

Then reload the notebook page and should be good.
